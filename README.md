## Barney Wilton

Since finishing University I have been working within tech in various roles, starting in digital marketing and working my way into data analytics.

I began programming in my spare time during the first covid lockdown. Finding that I had a strong sense of logic and got a lot of enjoyment out of solving all the intricate, unique problems that could arise.

The endless possibilities that programming and tech bring have led to many nights of descending into rabbit holes and discovering new things I'd never even considered before.

After completing my time at Makers Academy, my goal is to change into a career in programming and to help create solutions to problems that the world may not even know exist yet.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### MA Digital Marketing -  Sep 2017 - Jul 2018 - University of Portsmouth
My dissertation dealt with the creation and implementation of a successful digital marketing campaign for a community choir.
The campaign included managing social media channels along with the creation of a website to be used for marketing activities.

#### BEng Mechanical Engineering -  Sep 2011 - Jul 2015 - University of Portsmouth
My dissertation dealt with deflection in carbon fibre shafts when exposed to varying masses.
The objective was to design an optimal carbon fibre structure to improve a golf player's swing.
Ultimately the project did not achieve any improvement on the existing design, but I learned a lot about how carbon fibre behaves under load.

#### Any other qualifications


## Hobbies

- All things guitar. Currently in the process of forming a band with some of my friends and looking forward to the challenges this may pose. 
- Bouldering. I go climbing twice a week, specifically to do bouldering. The combination of physical exertion and mental challenge provided by this sport is fascinating to me.
- I go running at least three times a week. Iâ€™m currently working on getting my 5k time under 20 minutes. Although I have a long way to go!
- Skiing and Snowboarding. Another outdoor sport that I cannot get enough of.
